### .cham file specifications

 - Dimensions
 - Layers
 - How to organize .png files for the compiler

### Dimensions

The first line contains the dimensions of the chamber in tile width (we could refer to these as meters, if necessary)
using a string "#x#". These dimensions are x by y. The first "y" number of characters will be the leftmost column of the chamber, and the next "y" number of characters will be the column to the right.

If the string was "abcd", then the pixels in the 2x2 grid would be:

|       |       |
| :---: | :---: |
|   a   |   c   |
|   b   |   d   |

### Layers

The layers (for now) consist of foreground, background, and music. More layers can be added as necessary. These layers are specified in the .cham format with a two-character abbreviation at the beginning of the row:

fg:
bg:
mu:

The layers don't have to be in order, but if the compiler does its job correctly, it will.

### Organization of /chambers dir

Organizing the directory is simple. Each chamber will have its own directory within the /chambers directory. These individual chamber directories will be the name of the chamber. Each png file will have \<chambername\>_\<layername\>.png format. This can be seen in the example tree shown below.
